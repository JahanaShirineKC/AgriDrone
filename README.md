# AgriDrone

This repository contains the code and simulations for an agricultural drone system designed for two primary applications: mango harvesting and palm pest management. The project leverages autonomous drones equipped with specialized end-effectors and sensors to efficiently and effectively manage these tasks.
# Mango Harvesting
Objective: Develop an automated solution for precise and efficient harvesting of mangoes using a drone with a robotic arm and gripper mechanism.


Key Features:

Robotic Arm and Gripper: A simulated robotic arm with a gripper designed to securely grasp and cut mangoes from trees. The gripper mechanism is programmed to close upon detecting a mango and open once the fruit is harvested.
Intel RealSense Camera Integration: Utilizes depth-sensing cameras to detect mangoes, determine their coordinates, and guide the robotic arm accurately.
Cutting Mechanism: Simulation includes the process of cutting mangoes from the tree using a coordinate-based bounding box system.
Path Planning and Control: Advanced algorithms for path planning and control to navigate the drone to each mango location and perform harvesting operations efficiently.
Simulation Details:

The simulation demonstrates the movement of the manipulator and end-effector towards the mango, the closing of the gripper, and the retrieval of the fruit.
Plots and animations illustrate the detection of mangoes and the actions of the robotic arm.
# Palm Pest Management
Objective: Develop an automated solution for targeted pest management in palm trees using a drone equipped with spraying mechanisms and sound wave emitters.

Key Features:

Spraying Mechanism: A system to spray liquid pesticides precisely on pest-affected areas of palm trees. The simulation includes a bounding box around the pest-affected area and calculates the distance to the center for accurate spraying.

Simulation Details:

The simulation shows the drone applying liquid pesticides .
